## Arrays

### Initiate

Since we are just subclassing JavaScript's Array, you can instantiate the array the same way

```javascript
import { Arr } from 'flooent'

Arr.from([1, 2, 3])
// or
Arr.of(1, 2, 3)
```

## Strings

Since we are just subclassing JavaScript's String object, you can instantiate it the same way

```javascript
import { Str } from 'flooent'


```
